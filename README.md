# MixWell

MixWell is a program designed to help DJs pick songs to mix into.

## Description

MixWell is a simple but powerful program. All you need to do is enter any song you are playing and MixWell will use Spotify to give you a selection of songs based on the entered song's tempo, key, energy level, and genre!
This makes making mashups, and mixes, and knowing what to play next an absolute breeze.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

MixWell is fully written in Python using Spotipy. You will need to have Python Downloaded.

### Installing

You can download the zip straight from GitHub. Afterward, you will need to create a .env file to fill with your Client_ID and Client_Secret. Otherwise, it won't authenticate and the search won't run.

### Executing program

* Launch the .exe file located in the dist folder
* Type a song into the search bar
* Click the search button
* Enjoy
